# Announcing the October 2016 Update for .NET Core 1.0

The title may be a bit grand for what’s included in this month’s update but it is important for folks encountering this specific issue. Look for more next month.

We are releasing an update today which addresses an issue installing on a clean macOS Sierra system. The change is limited to the macOS installer. There are no changes in the runtime or tools; .NET Core 1.0.1 remains the latest release for Windows and Linux.

You can download the updated [.NET Core 1.0.2 macOS SDK installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=831679) now.

For more information on the change, please see the [.NET Core 1.0.2 release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/releases/tag/1.0.2).

If you are having trouble, we want to know about it. Please report issues on [GitHub issue – core xxx](blah).

Thanks to everyone who reported this issue.
